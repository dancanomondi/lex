Verb Recognition LEX Program
This LEX program recognizes a set of verbs specified in the given list. It scans input text and identifies the verbs from the set, providing their recognition with the "VERB: " prefix.

Code Explanation
The LEX specification file (recognize_verbs.l) contains the following sections:

%option noyywrap: This option is used to disable the default wrap-around feature of the lexer.

%%: This delimiter separates the three sections of a LEX file: the definitions, rules, and user code.

is|am|are|were|was|be|being|been|do|does|did|will|would|should|can|could|has|have|had|go: This rule matches any of the verbs provided in the set. When a verb is found, the corresponding action prints "VERB: " followed by the matched verb using yytext.

.: This rule matches any character that is not captured by the previous rule. It ensures that we progress through the input.

int main() { ... }: This is the entry point of the program. It calls yylex() to start scanning the input and then returns 0 to exit the program.

Running the Program
To run the Verb Recognition program, follow these steps:

Save the LEX specification file (recognize_verbs.lex) on your system.

Compile the LEX program using the following commands:

Copy code
lex recognize_verbs.lex
gcc lex.yy.c -o recognize_verbs -ll
Execute the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./recognize_verbs < input_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to the file you want to analyze, or you can provide input by typing directly into the terminal.

The program will scan the input text and recognize the verbs from the given set, displaying each recognized verb with the "VERB: " prefix.

Sample Input
Here's a sample input_file.txt that you can use to test the Verb Recognition program:

kotlin
Copy code
The verbs in this sentence are: is, was, be, do, will, can, has, had.
The word "been" is also a verb.
I should go to the park.
Save the above content into a file named input_file.txt and use it as input for the program.

The output will be:

vbnet
Copy code
VERB: is
VERB: was
VERB: be
VERB: do
VERB: will
VERB: can
VERB: has
VERB: had
VERB: been
VERB: should
VERB: go
Each recognized verb from the given set will be displayed on a new line with the "VERB: " prefix.

Please make sure to save the LEX program and the README.md file in the same directory, and follow the instructions provided in the readme to compile and run the program successfully.
