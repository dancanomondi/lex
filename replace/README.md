Introduction
The Replace "abc" with "ABC" LEX program accepts English language words and replaces each occurrence of the string "abc" with "ABC". It utilizes regular expressions to identify and modify the input accordingly.

Code Explanation
The LEX specification file (replace_abc.lex) includes the following sections:

%option noyywrap: This option disables the default wrap-around feature of the lexer.

%%: This delimiter separates the three sections of a LEX file: the definitions, rules, and user code.

[a-zA-Z]+: This rule matches one or more alphabetical characters, indicating English words. When a word is found, the corresponding action iterates over each character. If the substring "abc" is found at the beginning of the word, it is replaced with "ABC", and the loop continues from the next character. Otherwise, the character is printed as-is.

.: This rule matches any character that is not captured by the previous rule. It ensures that we progress through the input and ignore any characters that are not English words.

int main() { ... }: This is the entry point of the program. It calls yylex() to start scanning the input and then returns 0 to exit the program.

Running the Program
To run the Replace "abc" with "ABC" program, follow these steps:

Save the LEX specification file (replace_abc.lex) on your system.

Compile the LEX program using the following commands:

Copy code
lex replace_abc.lex
gcc lex.yy.c -o replace_abc -ll
Execute the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./replace_abc < input_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to the file you want to analyze.

The program will accept English language words, replace occurrences of "abc" with "ABC", and display the modified words.

Please make sure to save the respective LEX programs with the given filenames and follow the instructions in the corresponding readme files to compile and run the programs.
